# Booking Terms & Conditions

**Last Updated:** May 2025

These Terms apply to all bookings for tennis events, tennis academies, coaching sessions, clinics, camps, holidays, tours and related services offered by Active Away. By making a booking you agree to these Terms in full.

## 1. About Us

Active Away Limited (company number 05969829, registered address: Palliser House, Palliser Road, London W14 9EQ) ("we", "us", "our", "Active Away") organises tennis holidays, tennis clinics, tennis academies, padel holidays, pickleball holidays, ski holidays, school tennis tours and related sports events (together "Services"). Contact us at hello@activeaway.com or 020 7965 7277. We act as principal for all Services.

## 2. Your Contract with Us

A binding contract is formed when we send you written confirmation of your booking (usually by email). These Terms form part of that contract. Please read them carefully before booking. We may update these Terms from time to time; the version in force at the date of your booking will apply.

## 3. Deposits and Payments

A non-refundable deposit is due at time of booking (amount varies by Service and will be specified). The balance of the total price is due no later than 8 weeks before your start date ("Final Balance Date"). If you book within 8 weeks of the start date, full payment is due immediately. Failure to pay by the Final Balance Date may result in cancellation and forfeiture of amounts paid. We accept payment by card or bank transfer.

## 4. Pricing

Prices are shown on our website or in our confirmation emails and are subject to availability. They include what is stated in the booking confirmation but exclude items marked as optional extras, personal expenses, travel insurance, flights (unless specified), and anything not expressly included. We reserve the right to correct pricing errors; if a material error occurs you may cancel without penalty or pay the correct price.

## 5. What's Included

For tennis holidays and multi-day events: typically includes accommodation (unless non-residential), specified meals, tennis coaching sessions, court access, and on-site host services as described in your booking details. For one-day or short clinics/sessions: typically includes the specified coaching, court hire during session, and any equipment hire if stated. Full details of inclusions are provided before you book. Items such as flights, transfers, equipment rental (unless stated), personal insurance, personal expenses, and optional activities/excursions are generally not included unless expressly stated.

## 6. What's Not Included

Unless expressly included in your booking: flights, airport/hotel transfers, travel insurance, racket/equipment hire, laundry, telephone calls, room service, spa treatments, additional meals or drinks beyond those stated, and optional excursions. You are responsible for arranging and paying for these separately.

## 7. Travel Insurance and Passport/Visa

You must have adequate travel insurance covering medical expenses, cancellation, curtailment, personal belongings, and liability. We strongly recommend insuring at the time of booking. For overseas events, you must hold a valid passport (usually with at least 6 months' validity beyond your return date) and obtain any necessary visas. We are not liable if you are refused entry or exit to/from any country.

## 8. Your Responsibilities

You must provide accurate contact and personal details. You must disclose any medical conditions or physical limitations that may affect your safe participation. You must behave respectfully and follow instructions from our staff and venue personnel. You must not bring the reputation of Active Away or the venue into disrepute. Parents/guardians are responsible for junior participants' behavior and wellbeing. You must not smoke in non-smoking areas or engage in illegal activities.

## 9. Cancellations by You

You may cancel your booking by emailing us in writing. Cancellation fees apply as follows (based on notice period before start date): more than 8 weeks = loss of deposit only; 4-8 weeks = 50% of total price; 2-4 weeks = 75% of total price; less than 2 weeks = 100% of total price. Deposits are non-refundable in all circumstances. If you have valid travel insurance, you may be able to reclaim some costs under your policy.

## 10. Cancellations or Changes by Us

We aim to operate all Services as planned. However, we reserve the right to cancel or make changes if necessary (e.g., due to insufficient bookings, force majeure, safety concerns, or venue unavailability). If we cancel, we will offer you an alternative date/location or a full refund (excluding any non-refundable third-party costs you have incurred). We are not liable for any consequential losses if we must cancel. Minor changes (e.g., change of coach or minor itinerary adjustments) do not entitle you to cancel or claim compensation.

## 11. Force Majeure

We are not liable for failure to perform our obligations due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including (but not limited to): acts of God, war, terrorism, civil unrest, industrial disputes, natural disasters, pandemics, government restrictions, travel bans, or failure of suppliers/subcontractors. In such cases, we will attempt to offer you an alternative or refund where reasonable, but we have no further liability.

## 12. Health, Safety and Fitness

Tennis and other racket sports carry inherent risk of injury. You confirm you are fit and healthy enough to participate. If in doubt, consult a doctor before booking. By participating you accept these risks. You must follow safety instructions and warm up properly. We provide coaching and guidance but cannot eliminate all risk. Children/juniors must be supervised as appropriate. You must inform us of any medical conditions, injuries, allergies, or dietary requirements that may affect your participation or safety.

## 13. Conduct and Liability for Damage

You must behave courteously and comply with venue rules, laws, and social norms. We reserve the right to exclude you from a Service if your behavior is abusive, dangerous, disruptive, or likely to cause distress, damage, danger, or annoyance to others, or breaches venue rules. You are responsible for any damage you cause to courts, equipment, or facilities.

## 14. Liability

We do not exclude or limit liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraud, or any liability that cannot be excluded under English law. Subject to the foregoing, our total liability to you for any claim arising from a booking is limited to the amount you paid for that booking. We are not liable for indirect or consequential losses (including loss of enjoyment or travel costs). Participation in racket sports involves inherent risk; by booking you accept those risks and agree to follow safety instructions.

## 15. Photography and Media

By booking you consent to us using photos/short video of your participation for academy marketing (website and social media). To opt out, email us in writing no later than 48 hours before your session.

## 16. Complaints

Please raise any issue immediately with the coach/desk so we can assist on the spot. If not resolved, email us in writing within 28 days of your session with details of the issue.

## 17. Data Protection

We process personal data in order to manage bookings and deliver services, and may share data with venue staff and contracted coaches as necessary. For details, contact us at the email above.

## 18. General

The academy may update opening hours, access rules, and equipment policies from time to time; current rules are displayed on site or at booking. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in force.

## 19. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of England and Wales and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction. Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights.
